Feb. 2021 - Frontend Developer Technical Test
==============================================

The goal of this test is to assess your familiarity with React, React Native, Redux, Hooks & CSS. You'll be building a mobile app that shows a list of restaurants in a 3km radius of the current user's position using a mock API.

## Task
Your task is to build a mobile app (using [the mockups provided](/mockup.pdf)) that asks permission to access the user's position, collects the user position, shows a list of restaurants nearby and a restaurant's detail when a user clicks on a restaurant list item. Here are the screens to implement:
* Onboarding Screen: Explain what the app does and ask for the user's position.
* Restaurant List Screen: Show a list of restaurants in a 3km radius of the user using a mock API.
* Restaurant Detail Screen: Show basic information about a selected restaurant.
